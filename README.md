Outlier Detection and Correlation Analysis
This notebook focuses on detecting and treating outliers in a house price dataset, as well as conducting a correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different features.
Dataset Description
The dataset used contains various features related to houses, such as total square feet, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, and price.
Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix and heatmap were generated to analyze the correlations between these features.
The correlation analysis revealed insights such as:
Total square footage has a strong positive correlation with the number of bathrooms and the price, suggesting that larger houses tend to have more bathrooms and command higher prices.
The number of bathrooms also has a moderately positive correlation with the price, indicating that houses with more bathrooms are generally priced higher.
The number of bedrooms has a relatively weaker positive correlation with the total square footage, bathrooms, and price compared to the other features.
The price per square foot shows moderate positive correlations with most other features, implying that it is influenced by various factors but not exceptionally strongly.
